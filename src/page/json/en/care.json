        "content2":"It is recommended to brush the Ragdoll once or twice a week to help it get rid of dead hair, preventing them from accumulating in its intestines and forming trichobezoars. When brushing, it is important to pay special attention to the 'pants' area on the cat's hindquarters, where the hair is usually denser and thicker. Occasionally, the Ragdoll may also need a bath. Dental care is essential to prevent periodontal diseases caused by tartar, and it is also necessary to trim its claws regularly, as they wear down very slowly."
